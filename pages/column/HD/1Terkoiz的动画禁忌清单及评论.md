**Terkoiz:**
所以我有个想分享的动画禁忌清单。欢迎补充。这不是教程而是个持续更新的坏动画习惯清单/动画快速提示。欢迎参与补充！尽量让这些禁忌少依赖个人偏好。

* = 某种程度是偏好
a-z = 紧密相关

# 动画禁忌
1.半途而废 & 抱怨
频繁放弃项目并抱怨为什么自己一事无成

2a.时间≠质量
认为花费更多时间=更高质量。你花几周做的10帧走路循环并不能决定整体项目质量

2b.长度≠质量
30分钟的无意义内容就是30分钟的无意义内容

3.难度≠质量
做不必要的困难事情不会让它变得更好。如果你花3小时用渐变做模糊效果...不错。我用模糊滤镜只花了3秒

4.过度详细的草图
没人会看/理解/关心你的笔记

5.草图≠成品动画
除非这就是你要的风格，否则最好确保它是精致、美观且有目的的

6.不休息≠最佳效果
耐心很好，但知道何时休息更重要。除非你习惯了，否则不间断工作会降低整体质量。你会开始忽略一些可能懒得修改的错误。至少花3分钟伸展/喝水/躺床上。说真的，躺床上3分钟会让你感觉像刚重新开始动画

7.一稿不够
精修、精修、再精修。初稿可能不错，但终稿更好。只做一遍不编辑之前帧很可能会得到糟糕结果

8.看不出"很烂"
如果看起来烂，那就是烂

9.重复≠好进步
重复只能带你走这么远。如果你反复做同样的动画，比如出拳。你可能擅长动画出拳...但仅此而已。尝试别的

10.对静态风格的误解
除非你是krinkels，否则这永远不会发生

11a.害怕复制已有风格
有些人可能因特定动画风格被记住。那又怎样？有些人会完全避开那种风格做全新东西。有时不错。但多数时候非常不必要且讨厌。你总得从某处开始！

11b.害怕突破已有风格
如果你觉得自己掌握了一种风格，再发展它。将新技术/方法/影响融入你的风格来真正定义它。活出点花样

12.相似颜色叠加
白底浅灰文字是坏习惯（类似深蓝配蓝等）。经验法则：如果狗都看不见，我可能也看不见

13a.快速浮动文字=粗糙
我知道我有罪...可能还助长了这股歪风u_u 但要做优秀动画，请远离那些快速浮动文字。真的很烦人。如果要用浮动文字，让它符合世界观或情境

13b.光速文字
我读不懂900000mph的文字。简单

13c.2秒内显示段落
*参见13a

13d.表情符号= :(
当你需要用2个字符简化情绪时，通常很糟糕

14.标签使用不当
假设你动画里有个闪亮的金属圆形物体，顶部有两个条状开口。作为观众我不知道那是什么，但概念上是个烤面包机。你有两个选择：要么在某处放两片面包。要么用72号漫画红字写上"烤面包机"并指向它（提示：选面包）

15.不合逻辑的音效
特别是尖叫声。角色像被撕开躯干般尖叫，实际上只是脚趾踢到东西，这不是好做法

15b.不重复使用音效
"音效缺乏创意。我经常看到人们索要（特定）武器声或（特定）声音，其实这些是多个声音的组合。比如你有个叫pistol-usp45.wav的文件，需要非usp手枪的枪声，为什么不用它呢？为什么要纠缠于'一个被踢到空中然后坠落着地的人'这种特定声音？啊啊啊啊啊"
-Pepper

16.节奏断裂
任何不连贯都会破坏节奏！（视角错误、缺失肢体/头部、随机面部、滥用音效等）

17.持续快速转场
如果每个场景都2帧转场，就像32倍速看电影。我会看不懂发生了什么

18*.单调节奏
给动画加点重音能创造奇迹。加入慢动作、特写、构图变化。用音乐同步创造重音机会！

19.快速动画≠技术
如果你2分钟内做完跑步循环，不错。我喜欢他跛行且有三条腿。那是额外的膝盖吗？

20.比例正确的视角。求你了
如果要使用，请检查比例（例如550x400是11:8比例。你的视角应保持11:8。除非你想挤压。那样的话我觉得你疯了）

21."这个很难动画 : ("
我管你，做就完了

22*.永远不单帧绘制
我知道这像个人偏好，但为大项目每帧都画间隔会永远做不完。我试过，不好玩且效率低下。完成时可能很酷，但看看你在近乎无意义的帧上浪费了多少时间。除非你有工作室能雇实习生做中间帧，否则建议只做少量中间帧而非全部。图像印象＞图像运动

23.第一周障碍
通常，当你开始大项目时，前1-2天会认真动画并充实它。你纯粹靠即时灵感爆发，取得显著进展。第3天失去兴趣。灵感可能没那么强，多数人在此放弃。如果你第3天继续动画，你会想"嗯...这比我想的耗时"。第4-5天你陷入日常例行，只是尝试（或希望）完成但知道做不到。多数人止步于此。第6-7天，你因"不值得花时间"或"太野心"而放弃。这时（*参见1.）就来了

24a*.拒绝批评
"本来就要那样。"不。不是的

24b.具体化批评
给批评者一些你自觉需要帮助的背景。如果你问批评者"cnc thx"，他们可能列出你已从5个人那里听过的最表面部分（那个场景很奇怪x5）。向批评者建议你已通过共识确认的内容，看他们能否提出别的。或提出你真正想要意见的动画方面

24c.注意力索取者
"我注意到的另一点是人们过早炫耀作品，获得渴望的正面反馈后就放弃项目，因为他们已得到想要的。这就是为什么我讨厌有人拼命要我评价10帧打斗开场，当我说它烂因为没什么可评价时他们就生气。他们可能觉得我混蛋，但我刚给了他们完成它的借口，向我证明他们能做到，让我因怀疑显得愚蠢"
-Jeff

25."没数位板不能动画"
有趣事实：动画发明于数位板之前

26.旧想法≠差
你搁置了一个早期项目很有前景的草图；时间流逝你一直没回头。一段时间后你重看旧草图。虽然它很酷，但你想"老东西了...不如用新草图"。你不知道这每次都让我多难过

27a.在不需要时求助
你不知道光是看东西能让你进步多少

27b.在不需要处求助
例子：水效果不错；火效果很糟。你因各种原因（舒适、满足、轻松等）练习水效果，却无视糟糕的火效果。当你有水火效果的动画时，烂火效果会比好水效果更突出

28.统一风格
"统一风格"难读吗？动画同理。想象Supranova非常流畅且强调透视的风格。突然变成Tentionmaru的。没有任何理由会让你完全出戏！

29.害怕实验
虽然我认为现在多数火柴人动画感觉平淡重复，但作为学习基础的另类必经之路很有必要。真正让我困扰的是害怕将这些基础应用于创意。你知道可以用一条线、一个补间和＞10次点击重现3分钟噪音音频表现吗

**Jeff:**

24条有很多例外 我觉得。虽然应该接受批评 但有些人确实不理解你在某些情况下的追求 经常批评他们不理解的东西。如果这说得通的话

另一个我注意到的大问题是人们过早炫耀作品 获得渴望的正面反馈后就放弃项目 因为他们已经得到想要的了。这就是为什么我讨厌有人拼命要我评价10帧打斗开场 当我说它烂因为没什么可评价时他们就生气。他们可能觉得我混蛋 但我刚给了他们完成它的借口 向我证明他们能做到 让我因怀疑显得愚蠢

**dkuo:**

笑死 25条 <_<

我jctml部分有一半是用触摸板完成的。数位板只是让事情更容易 人们体验过后往往会懈怠(比如我) 但如果你从没用过 抱怨就没道理

你写的理由其实不太适用 因为传统动画是铅笔+纸 数位板实际上是在模拟那种感觉。更应该指出数位板只是比平均水平快一点 除此之外没太大作用(除非你在画画)

另外11条让我想起"没有东西是原创的"这句话 在这个火柴人为主的社区尤其正确。我们都不该担心风格问题 放手去做开心就好

好帖子 :)
***
**Shho:**

好帖子 我发现这些基本都成立。Jeff的观点也很对 绝对值得列入清单。我见过无数次这种情况 很糟糕

(dkuo写道:

你写的理由其实不太适用 因为传统动画是铅笔+纸 数位板实际上是在模拟那种感觉。更应该指出数位板只是比平均水平快一点 除此之外没太大作用(除非你在画画))

我认为25条的理由是适用的 因为虽然传统动画是纸笔 但它仍然是动画。即使没有扫描仪 拿个这些就能开搞!

***
**dkuo:**

我的意思是数位板之所以受欢迎 是因为它模拟了古代纸笔动画的工作流程。如果说动画存在于数位板之前 反而应该强化使用数位板 因为那就是过去的做法!

总之 动画发明于数位板之前与"没有数位板不能动画"的论点无关

我当然同意没有数位板不该阻止人们做动画 数位板只是让事情更简单。但不使用数位板的理由不该基于"动画存在于数位板之前"的逻辑 而应该基于克服懒惰的行为

编辑 - 用鼠标比扫描便利贴简单多了

***
**Terkoiz:**

我确实该把25条改得没那么歧义。我只是指出很多人把懒惰归咎于缺少/故障的设备 对多数人来说那其实是奢侈品。技术上你不需要数位板。比如dkuo就没有数位板的奢侈。如果dkuo是我说的那种人 他会完全停止动画。相反 他用触摸板在dicks2.swf里创造了辉煌的部分。震撼我( @dkuo 你就是我写25条的原因 笑)

与其聚焦于拥有数位板的普遍做法 我只是引用它因为(对多数数字艺术家来说)数位板是最常见的奢侈品 人们不明白它并非必需品

就像说"没有叉子我不能吃鸡肉"

***
**Jomm:**

笑死老兄这太棒了 我爱了

让我困扰的是 比如我脸书上的动画师朋友/现实中的朋友因为不知道什么软件"最好"而犹豫开始动画; 嘿老兄我该用ADOBE FLASH MACROMEDIA FLASH PIVOT EZTOON还是纸? 不知道 ): 或者什么是"正确"配置; "我想开始新项目 但不知道Hyun用什么缩放%平滑度和工具来动画!!"

这个发过了吗? 凌晨4点我好累哈哈 不过好帖子!

## 原版文字:
So I have a list of animation taboos I'd like to share.Feel free to contribute.This isn't a tutorial but rather a constantly updating list of bad animation habits / quick tips for animation.Feel free to contribute to some! Try to keep the taboos less dependent on preferences.

* = Sort of preference
a-z = Closely related

Animation Taboos

1.Quit & Complain
Frequently quitting projects and complaining why they haven't done anything.

2a.Time =/= Quality
Thinking that more time spent in a project = more quality.That 10 frame walk cycle you spent weeks on does not determine the quality of your overall project.

2b.Length =/= Quality
30 minutes of nothing happening is 30 minutes of nothing happening.

3.Difficulty =/= Quality
Doing something unnecessarily difficult does not makes it better.If you made a blur effect with all gradients that took you 3 hours...neat.I used blur filter and took me 3 seconds.

4.Overly Detailed Sketches
No one is going to see / understand / care about your notes.

5.Sketches =/= Finished Animation
Unless that's the style, you better make sure it's polished, pretty, and purposeful.

6.No Breaks =/= Best Results
It's good to patient, but it's better to know when you've had it.Unless you're used to it, non-stop constant work will hinder your overall quality.You'll start to glance over some errors you may not bother going over.TAKE AT LEAST 3 MINUTES to stretch or get water or lie down on a bed.Seriously, lie down on a bed for like 3 minutes and you'll feel like you just started animating again.

7.One draft is not fine
Refine, refine, refine.A first draft may be good but a final draft is better.Going through it once and not editing some previous frames will most likely give you bad results.

8.Not Knowing "that sucks"
IF IT LOOKS SHITTY, IT IS SHITTY.

9.Repetition =/= Good Progress
Repetition can only get you so far.If you're animating the same thing over and over, let's say animating a punch.You may be good at animating a punch..but that's it.Try something else.

10.Misconception of a static style
Unless you're krinkels, this never happens.

11a.Fear of copying an owned style
Some people may be remembered for a particular animation style.SO WHAT? Some people will try to completely avoid that style and do something completely new.Sometimes it can be good.Most of the times, it's just very unnecessary and obnoxious.You have to start somewhere!

11b.Fear of threading outside an owned style
If you feel like you've mastered a style, develop it some more.Incorporate new techniques / methods / influences into your style to really define it.LIVE A LITTLE.

12.Similar Color Layering
Light-gray text on a white background is bad practice.(Similar to dark blue on blue; etc.) Rule of thumb: If a dog can't see it, I probably can't as well.

13a.Quick Floating Texts = sloppy
I know I'm guilty for it..and probably gave fueled the fire u_u but for really excellent animation, stray away from those quick floating texts.It really is annoying.If you're going to use floating texts, make it fit the universe or the situation.

13b.LIGHTSPEED TEXT
I CANT READ 900000mph TEXT.SIMPLE.

13c.Paragraph in under 2 seconds.
*Refer to 13a.

13d.Emoticons = :(
It's generally bad when you have to simplify emotion into 2 characters.

14.Bad use of labels
Let's say there's this shiny metal rounded thing that has two strip-openings at the top referenced in your animation.As a viewer, I don't know what that is but in concept it's a toaster.You have two options: Either put two pieces of bread in there somewhere.OR put in 72-fontsize comic sans bright red text in there that says "TOASTER" pointing right at it.(Hint: bread.)

15.SFX that don't make sense
Particularly the scream sounds.Characters screaming like they're having their torso ripped open when in reality they just stubbed a toe IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE.

15b.Not Reusing SFX
"Not being creative with SFX.I see this far too often, people ask for (specific) weapon sound or (specific) sound which is actually several sounds.for instance, if you get a wav file called pistol-usp45.wav and you need a gunshot for a pistol which isn't a usp, why not just use it? why bother pepper for the specific sound of "A guy getting kicked into the air then falling and landing" and shit like that? UGGGGGGGGGH."
-Pepper

16.Breaks in pace
Anything inconsistent will break pace! (vcam errors, missing limbs/heads, random faces, abuse of sfx, etc.)

17.Consistently quick transitions
If each of your scenes transitions every 2 frames, it'll be like watching a movie in 32x speed.I won't know what's going on.

18*.Monotonous pacing
Accents to your animation can do wonders.Incorporate some slow mo, close ups, variation in framing.Use music synching for opportunities for accenting!

19.Fast Animation =/= Skill
If you animated a run cycle in under 2 minutes, cool beans.I like how he limps and has three legs.Is that an extra knee-cap?

20.PROPORTIONATE VCAMS.PLEASE.
If you're going to use it, please check the ratios of it.(i.e.550x400 has an 11:8 ratio.Your vcam should always remain at 11:8.Unless you plan on squishing.In which case, I think you're crazy.)

21."That's hard to animate : ("
IDGAF, DO IT.

22*.Never NOT single-framing
So I know this may come off as a preference but animating every interval of frames for a big complex project will take forever.I've done it before, it's not fun and it's very unproductive.It may look cool when you're finished with it, but look how much time you've wasted on near-meaningless frames.Unless you have a studio and can hire interns to inbetween for you, I suggest only doing a little bit of inbetweening instead of entirely inbetweening.The impression of an image > the movement of an image.

23.The First Week Hurdle
Generally, when you start a BIG project, you spend the first 1-2 days really animating and fleshing it out.You're purely on surge of immediate inspiration and you do some significant progress on it.On day 3, you lose interest.Your inspiration may not be as potent and most people quit at this point.If you manage to keep on animating on Day 3, you will think to yourself "Hmm..this is taking longer than I thought".Day 4-5 you're in the daily routine of just trying (or hoping) to get it done but you know it's not gonna happen.Majority of people stop here.Day 6-7, you quit cause "it's not worth my time" or "it's too ambitious".This is where (*Refer to 1.) comes in.

24a*.Blocking criticism
"It's suppose to look like that." No.No it's not.

24b.Specifiying Criticism
Give your criticizer some context on what YOU feel you need help on.If you ask your criticizer "cnc thx", they'll probably list the most superficial part you've already heard from 5 other people (That ONE scene looks weird x 5).Suggest to your criticizer things you've already confirmed through consensus and see if they can come up with anything else.Or suggest an aspect of the animation you really wanted opinion on.

24c.Attention Grabbers
"Another big thing I notice is people showing off what they've made too early, getting the positive feedback they crave and then abandoning the project because they've already gotten what they want out of it.This is why I hate it when someone is desperately trying to get me to critique their 10 frame opening of a fight, and when I tell them it fucking sucks because there's nothing to go on and they get pissy at me.They may think I'm being a dick, but I've just given them an excuse to finish it so they can prove to me they're capable of it and make me look stupid for doubting them"
-Jeff

25."I can't animate cause I don't have a tablet"
Here's a fun fact: Animation was invented before the tablet.

26.Old ideas =/= Bad
You shove aside a really promising sketch of an early project; time passes and you haven't really went back to it.After some time you revisit the old sketch.Although it looks cool, you think "Man that shit's old...I'm better off with a newer sketch".You don't know how much this makes me cry every time.

27a.Taking for help WHEN you don't need it
You don't know how much better you are off simply by LOOKING AT STUFF.

27b.Taking for help WHERE you don't need it
Example: Water effect looks decent; Fire effect looks terrible.You practice water effect because of whatever reason (comfort, satisfaction, ease, etc.) and you just disregard that shitty fire effect.Whenever you have an animation with fire and water effect, that shitty fire effect will stand out a lot more than your good water effect.

28.Consistent Styles
Was it hard to read that 'Consistent Styles'? Same thing applies to Animation.Imagine Supranova's really smooth and perspective-heavy style.Then suddenly, Tentionmaru's.It would throw you off completely without any justification!

29.Fear of experimenting
Although I think that most of the stick figure animations now feel really bland and just repetitive, I think it's pretty necessary as sort an alternate rite of passage in learning some foundation.The fear of actually taking those foundations and applying them to something creative is what bothers me.Did you know you can recreate a 3 minute noise audio representation with exactly ONE line and ONE tween and >10 mouse clicks

omg I should write these down on a slab and hang it on my wall.

Jeff:
Number 24 has a lot of exceptions, I would say.While you should be open to criticism, some people don't really understand what you're going for in certain situations, and often criticize something they don't understand.If that makes any sense.

Another big thing I notice is people showing off what they've made too early, getting the positive feedback they crave and then abandoning the project because they've already gotten what they want out of it.This is why I hate it when someone is desperately trying to get me to critique their 10 frame opening of a fight, and when I tell them it fucking sucks because there's nothing to go on they get pissy at me.They may think I'm being a dick, but I've just given them an excuse to finish it so they can prove to me they're capable of it and make me look stupid for doubting them.

lol 25 <_<

half of my jctml part was done with a touchpad.tablets just make things a lot easier and people tend to slack after they've 'experienced' it (namely me) but there's no reason to complain if you've never used one before imo

the reasoning you wrote for it isn't really applicable though, since traditional animation used to be pencil+paper and tablets are effectively emulating that feeling.rather it should be noted that tablets only make things a little faster than average but don't really do much outside of that (unless you're drawing)

also 11 reminds me of the saying 'nothing is original' which is like especially true considering the community is stick-figure oriented lol.none of us should be worried about style tbh, just go for it and have fun


good thread :)
***
Shho
Nice thread, I've found most if not all of these to be true.Jeff's point is also totally true, and I definitely believe it deserves a spot on that list.I've seen things like that happen countless times, and it sucks.

I do think the reasoning for 25 is applicable, because while traditional animation was pencil and paper, it was still animation.Even if you don't have a scanner, grab one of these and go wild!

***
dkuo
what i meant by my post was that tablet use is desired because it emulates the animation workflow from the olden days of pencil and paper.if anything, saying animation existed before the tablet should *reinforce* tablet use because that's how it used to be done!

all in all, animation being invented before tablet use isn't relevant to the argument of 'i cant animate because i dont have a tablet.'

i obviously agree that not having a tablet shouldn't stop people from animating, tablets just make it easier.but the reason for animating without one shouldn't be based off the logic of animation existing before tablets, but rather on the act of overcoming laziness.



edit - using a mouse would be easier than scanning stickynotes LOL

***
Terkoiz
I should really change #25 to something a bit less ambiguous.I was just pointing out that there's a lot of people blaming their laziness to a defective / lack of a device that comes in as a luxury to most people.You don't technically NEED a tablet.For example, dkuo doesn't have the luxury of a tablet.If dkuo were the people I'm talking about, he'd completely stop animating all together.Instead, he used a touchpad and created a glorious part in dicks2.swf on a touchpad.blew my mind.( @dkuo , you're the reason why I wrote #25 btw lol)

instead of focusing on the general practice of having a tablet, i'm just referencing it because (to most digital artists) a tablet is the most common luxury to have and people don't understand that it's not really a necessity.

like saying "i can't eat my chicken without a fork"

Jomm:
LOL man this is gold i love it

something that bugs me is how I've had some people for example on my animator facebook/friends in real life become hesitant to start animating because they don't know what program is the "best"; HEY MAN SHOULD I GET ADOBE FLASH MACROMEDIA FLASH PIVOT EZTOON PAPER? IDK ): or what "proper" specs are; "I want to start my new project, but I don't know what zoom% smoothing and tool Hyun uses to animate!!"

was this posted already? it's 4am im tired haha, great thread though!
